# Background

This was a project I made in year 10 (age 14 or 15) that I thought I had lost, but I found it in one of my backups. I'm still pretty happy with it, it was my way to learn about how HTML canvas works, and even though it's not perfect it's also not half bad! Only a hundred lines of code or so.

I haven't changed anything, the original brief is below, as our class got us to practice writing briefs for assignments, but they didn't have to be too serious.

The only things I've done is make a 404 page and deployed it with [Github Pages](bertkdowns.github.io/lookleftandright)

# LOOK LEFT AND RIGHT GAME

## Stakeholder Considerations

It must be good for little children. I.E no gory images and other very threatening things

## Tools to use
